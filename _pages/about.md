I'm a senior year computer science and engineering student at [Netaji Subhash Engineering College](https://nsec.ac.in) based out of [Kolkata](https://goo.gl/maps/JezzqBHDZnpeonq5A). I'm an independent researcher, trying to understand why Machine Learning Algorithms work the way they do. 😃

When I'm not working, you can find me flying ✈️  in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Although I'm very much interested in almost all of machine learning research, you can find me nerding most about these.

### Research Interests

- Geometric and Topological Deep Learning
- Topological Data Analysis
- Generative Models
- Optimal Transport
- Implicit Deep Learning

You can find CV [Here](./assets/pdf/Research%20Resume.pdf). If there's something I can help you about, or if you want to have an awesome discussion on some interesting research topic, do feel free to drop me a 📨 @ <adrishd.cse2017@nsec.ac.in>.
