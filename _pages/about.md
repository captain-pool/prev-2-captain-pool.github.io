Hey 👋 , Thanks for visiting my page! I'm a senior year computer science and engineering student at [Netaji Subhash Engineering College](https://nsec.ac.in) based out of [Kolkata](https://goo.gl/maps/JezzqBHDZnpeonq5A). I'm an independent researcher, trying to understand why Machine Learning Algorithms work the way they do. 😃

When I'm not working, you can find me flying ✈️ in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Although I'm very much interested in almost all of machine learning research, you can find me tweeting about these the most.

### Research Interests

- Generative Models
- Variational Methods
- Manifold Learning
- Geometric Deep Learning
- Deep Learning Theory

You can find CV [Here](./assets/pdf/Research%20Resume.pdf). If there's something I can help you about, or if you want to have an awesome discussion on some interesting research topic, do feel free to drop me a 📨 @ <rickdey1998@gmail.com>
