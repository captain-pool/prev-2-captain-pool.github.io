I'm a Deep Learning Engineer at [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai). I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Netaji Subhash Engineering College](https://nsec.ac.in). Currently, I am based out of [Kolkata](https://goo.gl/maps/JezzqBHDZnpeonq5A). I'm also an independent researcher, interested in exploring complicated problems in geometric and topological data processing.

When I'm not working, you can find me flying ✈️  in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

### Research Interests

Although my research interests spans a wide variety of topics, you can find me tweeting mostly about:

- Geometric and Topological Deep Learning
- Geometric Statistics
- Geometry Processing
- Topological Data Analysis
- Optimal Transport
- Generative Models
- Implicit Deep Learning

You can find CV [Here](./assets/pdf/Research%20Resume.pdf). If there's something I can help you about, or if you want to discuss abount some cool research problems, feel free to drop me a 📨 @ <adrishd.cse2017@nsec.ac.in>. More social / academic  URLs can be found [below 👇](#urls)
