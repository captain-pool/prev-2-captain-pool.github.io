I got into [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc) where I'll be working with the [TensorFlow Hub Team](https://tensorflow.org/hub) building pretrained modules. ðŸ¥³
 
**UPDATE**: The ESRGAN pretrained module can be found at: <https://tfhub.dev/captain-pool/esrgan-tf2-1>. And the codebase can be found at: <https://github.com/captain-pool/GSOC>
